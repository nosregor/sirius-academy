## AI Singing Coach

### Overview

This section outlines how the Sirius Boilerplate system could be extended into an **AI-powered singing coach** that guides students through daily 10-minute vocal sessions.
The goal is **not to implement** this feature within the challenge scope, but to demonstrate **how such a system could be modeled and designed** in a scalable, data-driven way.

### Concept

The AI Singing Coach helps students improve over time by:

- Analyzing **pitch, tone, and volume** in real time during practice sessions.
- Tracking **progress and performance history**.
- Generating **personalized learning paths** based on skill level, vocal range, and goals.
- Using **LLM-based feedback** to deliver human-like coaching and motivation.

### Entity Overview

#### `StudentProfile`

Stores personal data and learning preferences.

| Field             | Type                                       | Description                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `studentId`       | UUID                                       | Link to user                |
| `age`             | number                                     | Student age                 |
| `skillLevel`      | enum(`beginner`,`intermediate`,`advanced`) | Current ability             |
| `genrePreference` | string                                     | e.g., pop, classical        |
| `vocalRange`      | string                                     | e.g., A2–C5                 |
| `goals`           | string                                     | Personalized learning goals |

Note: Learning goals could be a separate Entity

#### `PracticeSession`

Represents a single singing session.

| Field          | Type | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | UUID | Session ID                                  |
| `studentId`    | UUID | Linked student                              |
| `date`         | Date | Session timestamp                           |
| `metrics`      | JSON | pitchAccuracy, toneStability, volumeControl |
| `aiFeedbackId` | UUID | Link to feedback record                     |

Note: Voice metrics could be a separate Entity

#### `AIFeedback`

Stores feedback generated by an LLM or ML model.

| Field             | Type   | Description                 |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `id`              | UUID   | Feedback record             |
| `sessionId`       | UUID   | Related session             |
| `summary`         | text   | Human-like feedback summary |
| `recommendations` | JSON   | Suggested exercises         |
| `score`           | number | Overall performance score   |

#### `LearningPath`

Tracks the student’s long-term progression.

| Field           | Type   | Description            |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `studentId`     | UUID   | Linked student         |
| `currentStage`  | string | Current skill area     |
| `nextExercises` | JSON   | Personalized plan      |
| `progressScore` | number | Quantified improvement |
| `updatedAt`     | Date   | Last recalculation     |

### System Flow

```
Student → starts PracticeSession
        → submits voice metrics
        → AI engine analyzes results
        → LLM generates feedback
        → LearningPath updated
        → Teacher can review progress
```

### Architectural Notes

- **Asynchronous AI Processing**
  Voice metrics and raw data are queued (e.g., via BullMQ or RabbitMQ) and processed asynchronously by an AI service.

- **Extensible Microservice Model**
  The core app remains NestJS-based; the AI engine can be a separate Nest or Python service communicating via REST or message queue.

- **Data Storage**
  PostgreSQL with JSON fields (metrics, exercises) for flexibility; could integrate TimescaleDB for time-series (voice) metrics later.

- **Privacy & Security**
  Audio data handled securely; student data anonymized before AI processing.

### Outcome

This design enables:

- Structured tracking of **student performance** and **session history**
- Gradual **personalized learning**
- Human-like **AI feedback loops**
- Seamless integration with the existing **Sirius fullstack system**

It remains conceptual but demonstrates how Sirius could evolve into a modern, data-driven AI vocal coaching platform.
