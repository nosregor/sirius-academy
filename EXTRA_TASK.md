## Extra Task Summary – AI Singing Coach (Sirius Boilerplate)

This document outlines the high-level design for an **AI-powered vocal training system** that guides students through personalized 10-minute daily sessions. It fulfills the optional extra task by defining a clear **data model**, **learning logic**, and **feedback flow** for adaptive progress tracking.

### Core Objectives

- **Track student progress** across measurable voice metrics (pitch, tone, volume).
- **Adapt daily vocal exercises** to each student’s evolving skill level, goals, and vocal range.
- **Deliver real-time, human-like feedback** generated by an LLM coach.
- **Store and analyze performance data** to shape a long-term personalized learning path.

### High-Level Data Model

Key entities include:

| Entity              | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **StudentProfile**  | Captures personal data: age, skill level, vocal range, preferred genre, and goals.             |
| **PracticeSession** | Represents a single 10-minute training session; linked to one student.                         |
| **VoiceMetric**     | Stores real-time vocal analytics such as pitch accuracy, tone quality, and volume consistency. |
| **Exercise**        | Defines structured vocal drills (warm-ups, range, breath control, etc.).                       |
| **LearningPath**    | Manages progression through exercises and milestones; adapts based on performance trends.      |
| **AIFeedback**      | Contains natural-language responses generated by the LLM coach for motivation and guidance.    |

### Personalization Logic

1. Each session begins with a **diagnostic warm-up** analyzed by a voice engine.
2. The system compares results against the **StudentProfile** and recent **VoiceMetrics**.
3. The **LearningPath engine** adjusts difficulty and focus (e.g., pitch vs tone).
4. The **LLM feedback generator** produces contextual, encouraging guidance.
5. Progress data updates the student’s **long-term trajectory** for subsequent sessions.

### System Architecture Overview

- **Voice Analysis Service** – Real-time pitch/tone extraction.
- **AI Feedback Service** – LLM prompt orchestration for human-like coaching.
- **Learning Path Engine** – Adaptive logic that updates student goals and exercises.
- **Core Data Layer** – PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB storing session and metric history.

### Outcome

A scalable, adaptive learning system that continuously personalizes vocal training, providing measurable progress and emotionally engaging feedback—fulfilling the Sirius extra task requirements for **tracking student progress** and **building personalized learning paths**.
